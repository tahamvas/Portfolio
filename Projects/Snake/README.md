Snake Game by Tyler Hamvas

A very simple Snake Game that I created as an experiment with Python. This is my first ever experience with Python and PyGame.

The player can manipulate movement of the snake in four basic directions. Collisiion handling is implemented with objects (apples) and can be eaten to grow in size. Additionally, when the player collides with walls or their own body, the game will end. 

Plans to implement a randomized chance of spawning a 'special apple' which will increase player speed for x seconds, as well as displaying a timer for said buff.
