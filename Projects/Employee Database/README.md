Employee Database app by Tyler Hamvas

This app was created as an experiment for linking SQL databases and C++ code. Using C++ to initiate the connection, this program then translates the commands into SQL to properly execute.

Searching, creating, deleting and modifying of data stored in the Oracle Database Server is possible with this program.
