# Portfolio
Personal Portfolio made by Tyler Hamvas

This project was created completely by myself in my own free time while studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca College.

Created using mainly ReactJS in order to exploring routing and hooks, some basic CSS3 was also used to implement styling. Node.js was used to help handle packages and well as server testing.

This website is fully hosted and the domain has been registered by myself. Many plans for the future to improve and upgrade my portfolio as I learn new skills and techniques throughout my studies.
